# Ribbons

A little music visualizer with Oculus Rift support.

## To do

- [X] ribbons radially outward
- [ ] smooth out amplitude
- [X] accelerate ribbons proportionally on beat?
- [ ] lines with l/r spectrum along sides or volume history
- [ ] album art: id3lib.sourceforge.net
- [ ] use speaker output

## OVR To do

- image size is too big
- fix incorrect zindexing
- ovr shutdown throws exception
- fix scaling of position
- show stars all around
- ribbons shouldn't disappear behind you, so have them continue and fade out
